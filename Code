# Step 1: Load the dataset
# Ensure emails.csv contains two columns: 'email' and 'label' (1 for Ham, 0 for Spam)
data = pd.read_csv('emails.csv')

# Extract features and labels
emails = data['email']  # Email content
labels = data['label']  # Labels (1 for Ham, 0 for Spam)

# Step 2: Split dataset into training and testing sets

# Step 3: Feature extraction using TfidfVectorizer

# Step 4: Train the SVM model

# Step 5: Make predictions on test data

# Step 6: Evaluate the model

# Step 7: Test on new input email
